# Customer Segmentation Project

In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.

To achieve that goal, I will go through under steps:
1. Importing libraries.
2. Loading data.
3. Data cleaing.
4. Data preprocessing.
5. Dimensionality reduction.
6. Clustering.
7. Evaluating model.
8. Profiling.
9. Conclusion.
